# Music App

A responsive music player application with modern design, developed with TypeScript.
<br><br>

## üìã About the Project

We developed this music player application as a team after completing the Frontend module in our DCI course. Our main goal was to deepen our knowledge of **JavaScript, CSS, and HTML** while learning **TypeScript** - a technology that is becoming increasingly important in modern web development.

We deliberately chose TypeScript, although it wasn't part of the course curriculum, to:
- Expand our programming skills
- Gain valuable practical experience with static typing
- Better prepare ourselves for the current job market
- Improve code quality and reliability
<br><br>
